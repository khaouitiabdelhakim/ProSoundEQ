## How to Use

To integrate ProSoundEQ into your Android project, follow these steps:

**Step 1. Add the JitPack Repository and Dependencies**

Add the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the ProSoundEQ library as a dependency in your app's build.gradle file. Replace `Tag` with the specific release version you want to use (latest version: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/khaouitiabdelhakim/ProSoundEQ.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#khaouitiabdelhakim/ProSoundEQ)):

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.khaouitiabdelhakim:ProSoundEQ:Tag'
}
```

**Step 2. Initialize ProSoundEQSettings**

Initialize the ProSoundEQSettings object to manage audio effects settings. This should be done after preparing the MediaPlayer:

```kotlin
// Initialize the MediaPlayer with the raw resource
mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(this, R.raw.song)

// Set a listener for when the media file is ready
mediaPlayer?.setOnPreparedListener {
    // Start playing the song when it's prepared
    mediaPlayer?.start()
    ProSoundEQSettings.setColor("#34ebb1")
    ProSoundEQSettings.init(mediaPlayer!!.audioSessionId)
}

// Opening the equalizer
startActivity(Intent(this, ProSoundEQ::class.java))
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml to access audio settings.

Feel free to explore and customize ProSoundEQ to suit your application's audio requirements. If you encounter issues, have suggestions for improvement, or want to contribute, we encourage you to get involved.
